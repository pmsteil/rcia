## Eucharist

If a brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what does it profit?

**Jeremiah 31:33** - "But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and theyshall be my people."*

## Final Notes

All scripture references taken from the RSVSCE translation.

I have not included any of the Old Testament references to the Law, as I believe that the Law was fulfilled in Christ as he said in Matthew 5:17 (RSVSCE): "Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them."
