# Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults
## St. John Paul II University Catholic Parish

### What is RCIA?
The Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA) is the process by which adults are initiated into the Catholic Church. It is a process of conversion and spiritual formation for individuals who have declared their desire to become Catholic and are seeking to enter into full communion with the Catholic Church.

The RCIA process is a restoration of the ancient catechumenate, arising within the first three centuries following the era of the apostles. It was the early Churchâ€™s way of Christianizing the pagan Roman Empire.

The Second Vatican Council called for the restoration and use of this venerable and powerful method of initiation for the worldwide Church.

### Who is RCIA for?
RCIA is for adults who have never been baptized, or who have been baptized in another Christian tradition and are seeking to enter into full communion with the Catholic Church.

### What is the process?
The RCIA process is a gradual process of conversion and spiritual formation. It is a process of discernment and growth in faith, leading to full initiation into the Catholic Church.

The process is divided into four periods, punctuated by three liturgical rites. The periods are:

1. Period of Inquiry
2. Period of Catechumenate
3. Period of Purification and Enlightenment
4. Period of Mystagogy

The liturgical rites are:

1. Rite of Acceptance into the Order of Catechumens
2. Rite of Election
3. Sacraments of Initiation

### How long does it take?
The RCIA process is not a program, but a process of conversion and spiritual formation. The length of time it takes to complete the process varies from person to person. The process is not complete until the individual has been fully initiated into the Catholic Church.

### What is the schedule?
This varies by Parish.  At St. John Paul II University Catholic Parish in Denton, TX, in 2023, the RCIA process begins in September and concludes at the Easter Vigil.  The RCIA process meets on Thursday evenings from 7pm to 8:30pm.  The process is not complete until the individual has been fully initiated into the Catholic Church.

### How do I get started?
