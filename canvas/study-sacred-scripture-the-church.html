<h3>First uses of the word Catholic to describe The Church</h3>
<p>The term "Catholic Church" to refer to the Christian Church appears to have been in use as early as the late first century or the beginning of the second century. One of the earliest known references to the "Catholic Church" is found in the writings of St. Ignatius of Antioch, who was a Christian bishop and martyr. St. Ignatius wrote a series of letters to various Christian communities on his way to martyrdom in <span style="background-color: #fbeeb8;"><strong>Rome around 107-110 AD</strong></span>. In his letter to the Smyrneans, he wrote:</p>
<p>"Wherever the bishop appears, there let the people be; as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church." <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- (<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm" target="_blank">Letter to the Smyrneans, Chapter 8</a>)</p>
<p>This quote indicates the use of the term "Catholic Church" to describe the universal Christian Church as a whole. It reflects the idea that the Church is not confined to a specific location but is present wherever the bishop, as a representative of the Church, is found. St. Ignatius' writings are among the earliest Christian documents outside the New Testament and provide valuable insights into the beliefs and organization of the early Christian communities.</p>
