<p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:121"><span>This video explores the ancient and biblical roots of Catholicism,</span><span> contrasting the Evangelical and Catholic perspectives.</span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:11"><span>The speaker,</span><span> Keith Little,</span><span> a former evangelical seeking to understand Catholicism,</span><span> is joined by Dr.</span><span> John Bergsma,</span><span> a former Protestant pastor turned Catholic priest.</span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:7"><span>Dr.</span><span> Bergsma explains that Catholicism,</span><span> unlike Evangelicalism,</span><span> views the Old Covenant as fulfilled,</span><span> not abolished,</span><span> in the New Covenant.</span><span> This means elements like priesthood,</span><span> sacrifice,</span><span> and other Old Testament rituals continue in the Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:107"><span>He delves into the early church fathers who shaped Catholicism,</span><span> highlighting their belief in the Eucharist's real presence,</span><span> the authority of bishops,</span><span> and the sacraments' significance.</span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:194"><span>Finally,</span><span> Dr.</span><span> Bergsma explores the Jewish roots of Catholicism,</span><span> revealing how many Catholic practices and beliefs,</span><span> like incense use,</span><span> vestments,</span><span> and specific feast celebrations,</span><span> stem from Judaism.</span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:130"><span>This video offers valuable insights for anyone interested in Catholicism and serves as a reminder of its rich and lengthy history.</span></p>
