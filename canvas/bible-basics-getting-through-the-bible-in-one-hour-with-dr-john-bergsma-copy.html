<p>Dr. John Bergsma is a theology professor at Franciscan University of Steubenville. He completed his doctoral studies in theology at Notre Dame and specializes in the Old Testament and Dead Sea Scrolls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Bergsma wrote a book called Bible Basics for Catholics that helps us see how the entire Bible fits together. He wants to give Catholics a good introduction to all 73 books of the Bible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, he shows how God made special agreements called covenants with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and King David. God promised to be their God and they promised to follow Him. These covenants prepared for Jesus, who came to make a New Covenant with all people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus said at the Last Supper that His blood "will be poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." His death and resurrection established the New Covenant where we are reconciled with God by grace.</p>
<p>So the Old Testament covenants point ahead to Jesus, and Jesus fulfills them in the New Covenant. This helps us see how the whole Bible tells one big story of God's love and faithfulness across history.</p>
<p>Dr. Bergsma's book gives everyday Catholics a simple framework to make sense of the different parts of the Bible. If we see the covenants connecting the Old and New Testaments, it helps us understand how the Bible reveals God's amazing plan to save us. Everything in Scripture is part of the same story!</p>
<p>So if you want a friendly introduction to the Bible that shows how all the pieces fit together, Dr. Bergsma's book is a great place to start. He helps us see the unity in Scripture and appreciate how the Bible guides our Catholic faith.</p>
<p>In this video Dr. Bergsma walks us through his book!</p>
