<p>Our first meeting on Thursday was amazing!&nbsp; And it will only get better from here!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some notes from the first week and info about the course materials:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>What you have signed up for is to inquire and learn about the Catholic Faith without any commitment. We will spend the next 8 lessons diving into fundamental topics as to what it means to be a Christian and more specifically a Catholic Christian.&nbsp; This is a chance for you to dive into the Faith and go deeper and also for you to get your questions answered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Please spend time preparing for each lesson.&nbsp; In the "modules" will be the materials you need to dive in.&nbsp; Please review the materials for each lesson as time allows.&nbsp; We don't have books yet, but those will be coming soon.&nbsp; The "Start Here" section are the most important materials to review prior to each week.&nbsp; The "Go Deeper" section is available for you to go deeper as time allows.&nbsp; Please always come to Thursday night class even if your time got away from you that week.&nbsp; But please try and allocate some dedicated time to your day for working on this material.&nbsp; I also will include a "Sacred Scripture Study" page each week to give you Scriptures you can use to dive into the Bible on our various topics.</li>
<li>If you do plan on coming into communion with the Church, and you have been baptized, you will need to locate a baptismal certificate or some way to show you were baptized.&nbsp; So please contact the Church where you were baptized and get some documentation if you don't already have something.&nbsp; If you cannot obtain this, please ask Dax about your next steps.</li>
<li>I encourage you to also find time to spend in PRAYER!&nbsp; It could be going to some <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://jp2denton.org/mass-times-adoration" target="_blank">daily Mass at St. John Paul II</a> (or your closest Catholic Church), it could be spending time with the Lord in Prayer and Bible Study.</li>
<li><strong>OK, I know this all may seem overwhelming!</strong>&nbsp; But don't let it be... just take one step at a time.&nbsp; Don't do it all at once, do it as you can.&nbsp; Let the LORD lead you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you missed class, please answer these 2 questions to the best of your ability in your journal: (We will answer these again at the end of the RCIA process and compare to your first answers.&nbsp; This is just for you, nothing to turn in :)&nbsp; If your answer is "I have no clue" - that is perfectly fine :)
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>What does it mean to be a Christian?</li>
<li>What does it mean to be a Catholic?</li>

<p>God Bless us All on this journey together!</p>
<p>In Christ, Patrick</p>
