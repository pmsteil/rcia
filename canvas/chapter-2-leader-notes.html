<p>From Credo Chapter 2:</p>
<p>The first thing that is necessary for every Christian is Faith... Faith brings about various good effects. The first is that through faith, the soul is united to God, and by it there is between the soul and God a union akin to marriage.</p>

<p>1. What is the role of Scripture in defining Truth for a Christian?</p>
<p>2. What is the role of the Church in defining Truth for a Christian?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Small Group Questions</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Why is it reasonable to be open to divine revelation?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Because in reality we can gleam truth about God and His Creation (including us).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Why are the books of the Bible - the books of the Bible?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Divinely inspired</li>
<li>A tradition of the Church</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Why do we need Sacred Tradition and the Magisterium for right interpretation of Scripture?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus started a Church, not a Bible</li>
<li>The Faith has always been taught by Tradition</li>
<li>Tradition is how we know that we still believe what Jesus taught the Apostles</li>
<li>Tradition keeps any generation from changing the Faith</li>
<li>Tradition keeps you and I firmly grounded in the Faith in Jesus instead of any "faith of man" that is invented for personal, political or other purposes not of God</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. What does God's Revelation in History, Scripture and Tradition teach us about life?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reality</li>
<li>Well, everything - all truth about who we are and who God is and what our relationship should be like</li>
<li>Truth's about the most fundamental things
<ul>
<li>Origin of Creation</li>
<li>Our Purpose
<ul>
<li>Why do we have dignity? Do we even have a purpose?&nbsp; Is it just to be of use to someone (like a King, Slaveowner, kidnapper, etc?)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Marriage / Family - God's revelation helps us to be better children, adults, spouses</li>
<li>Life and Death - To learn how to live fruitfully and die a happy death</li>
<li>Raising Children - To raise the Children to know love and serve God by learning His Truths</li>
<li>Dealing with Suffering of Life</li>
<li>What is our purpose? The same as Jesus - THE SALVATION OF THE WORLD</li>
</ul>
