<p>Thomas Aquinas</p>
<p>1. Why does something exist?</p>
<p>2. What is natural about our existence?</p>
<p>3. What's more impressive, the artist or the art?</p>
<p>God is greater than any of his works - the very author of beauty.&nbsp; God is infinmately more than His Creation - starts with Nothing.</p>
<p>He exists more than His existence.</p>
<p>Most rely on Faith to believe that God exists.&nbsp; Reasoning isn't enough to begin a relationship with Him.</p>
<p>Supernatural gift of Faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Small Group Questions</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. What do we mean by "God"?</strong></p>
<p>How do we define God? Is he an old man in the clouds?&nbsp; Is he part of creation at all?&nbsp; Why one God and not many?</p>
<p>A: God is that which is outside of time, space and material. Who caused the entire universe to come into existence. Who caused whatever happened to bring each of us into existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. What are the ramifications if we get God wrong?</strong></p>
<p>A: Our theology becomes disconnected from reality instead of explaining it.&nbsp; The world will be correct in accusing of us of believing of a make believe "sky daddy".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Do we personally have to be able to prove that God exists?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, because that work has been done for us and the intellectual answers are there in our tradition of the Catholic Church.&nbsp; We are firmly grounded here and for other traditions that are not firmly grounded here, they can cause scandal in the world if they cannot rightly defend their claims of the the God or the Trinity, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. How do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOU</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">KNOW</span> God exists?</strong></p>
<p>i.e. How have you personally experienced God and have a knowledge that he does indeed exist?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; Does understanding the "proofs" for God help or harm your personal knowledge and experience of God?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes because it helps to make our idea of "faith in something you cannot see" more real and helps us to realize that the proof for God is all around us in every breath we take, every atom that exists, the fact that we are human, living creatures.</p>
