<h2>Bible Study on the Nature of God</h2>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">The Sacred Scriptures, also known as the Bible, are the written Word of God. They contain the story of God's revelation to humanity through the history of the Chosen People of Israel and the early Christian Church.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">The Bible is a collection of 73 books - 46 in the Old Testament and 27 in the New Testament. The Old Testament tells the story of God's relationship with Israel before Christ. It includes books of law, history, wisdom, and prophecy. The New Testament contains the four Gospels which tell the story of Jesus's life, death, and resurrection, as well as letters from apostles to early Christian communities and the Book of Revelation.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">Catholics consider the Bible to be divinely inspired - God worked through the human writers' talents and experiences to reveal Himself. The Bible teaches us about who God is, His love for us, and His plan for our salvation.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">The Bible is central to Catholic faith. We proclaim readings from the Bible at every Mass. Studying and praying with Scripture helps us encounter God and grow deeper in our faith. I encourage you to spend time daily reading the Bible. One great way to do this is to read the daily Mass readings using the Laudate app. Immersing ourselves in Scripture will enrich our relationship with God and understanding of our faith.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">Here are some select readings from the Bible that are pertinent to this week's lesson.&nbsp; No need to read all of them.&nbsp; Read those that seem interesting to you as time allows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
