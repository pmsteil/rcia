<h2><strong>Chapter 3 - Intro to Prayer and the Sacraments</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What this chapter is about:</strong></h2>
<p>1. Prayer is the communing of our heart, mind and soul with God</p>
<p>2. Forms of prayer: adoration, contrition, thanksgiving, supplication (ACTS)</p>
<p>3. A Sacrament is "an efficacious sign of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted by the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us" (CCC 1131).&nbsp; i.e. A Sacrament is a means to help us grow in love of Jesus more deeply.&nbsp; They are seven ways that the Church makes Jesus real to us and allows us to grow ever more trusting in His love.</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
<li class="whitespace-normal">Prayer is an important way we communicate with God and strengthen our relationship with Him. Catholic prayer includes personal prayer, liturgical prayer, meditative prayer like the rosary, etc.</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">The sacraments are outward signs instituted by Christ to give grace. They are an integral part of Catholic life and worship.</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">There are seven sacraments: Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Reconciliation, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony.</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">The sacraments can be divided into three categories - sacraments of initiation (Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist), sacraments of healing (Reconciliation and Anointing of the Sick), and sacraments of service (Holy Orders and Matrimony).</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">The Eucharist, also called Holy Communion, is the central sacrament of the Catholic faith. Catholics believe the bread and wine become the body and blood of Jesus Christ during Mass.</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">Reconciliation or Confession is the sacrament by which Catholics obtain absolution or forgiveness from a priest for sins committed after Baptism.</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">In the sacrament of Baptism, we are freed from original sin, reborn as children of God, and incorporated into the Church.</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">Anointing of the Sick is the sacrament that provides spiritual and sometimes physical strength during an illness or old age.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
<li class="whitespace-normal">Baptism - The first sacrament of initiation where one is immersed in water or has water poured over one's head as a sign of cleansing from sin and being reborn in Christ. Instituted by Jesus before his Ascension (Matthew 28:19-20).</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">Confirmation - Completes the process of initiation by sealing baptized persons with the gift of the Holy Spirit to make them more perfect Christians and witnesses to the faith. Instituted by Jesus when he promised the Apostles the Holy Spirit (John 14:16-17, Acts 2:1-4).</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">Eucharist - The sacrament in which Catholics receive the body and blood of Christ under the appearance of bread and wine, becoming one with Him. Instituted by Jesus at the Last Supper (Matthew 26:26-28, Mark 14:22-24, Luke 22:19-20).</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">Reconciliation - Forgiveness for sins committed after baptism through confession to a priest and absolution. Instituted by Jesus when he gave the Apostles the power to forgive sins (John 20:23).</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">Anointing of the Sick - Offers healing, strength, and peace to those who are dangerously ill or old using oil and prayers. Instituted by Jesus when he sent out the Apostles to heal the sick (Mark 6:13, James 5:14-15).</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">Holy Orders - Ordains bishops, priests, and deacons to serve the people of God. Instituted by Jesus at the Last Supper (Luke 22:19-20) and when he told Peter to "feed my sheep" (John 21:15-17).</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal">Matrimony - Celebrates the union of a baptized man and woman as spouses, imaging Christ and the Church. Instituted by Jesus by elevating marriage (Matthew 19:4-6, Mark 10:6-9).</li>
</ul>

<li class="whitespace-normal">Reconciliation - Seeking forgiveness from priests like in 2 Samuel 12, prophets in certain eras acted as intermediaries</li>

<li class="whitespace-normal">Holy Orders - Levitical priesthood established by Moses for temple service and sacrifice (Exodus 28-29)</li>
