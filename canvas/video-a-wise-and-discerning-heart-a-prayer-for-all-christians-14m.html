<p>The LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream at night.<br>God said, "Ask something of me and I will give it to you."<br>Solomon answered:<br>"O LORD, my God, you have made me, your servant, king<br>to succeed my father David;<br>but I am a mere youth, not knowing at all how to act.<br>I serve you in the midst of the people whom you have chosen,<br>a people so vast that it cannot be numbered or counted.<br>Give your servant, therefore, an understanding heart<br>to judge your people and to distinguish right from wrong.<br>For who is able to govern this vast people of yours?"</p>
<p>The LORD was pleased that Solomon made this request.<br>So God said to him:<br>"Because you have asked for this—<br>not for a long life for yourself,<br>nor for riches,<br>nor for the life of your enemies,<br>but for understanding so that you may know what is right—<br>I do as you requested.<br>I give you a heart so wise and understanding<br>that there has never been anyone like you up to now,<br>and after you there will come no one to equal you."</p>
