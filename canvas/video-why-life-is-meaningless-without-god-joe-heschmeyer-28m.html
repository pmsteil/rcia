<p class="p1"><span>This video is a philosophical discussion about the idea that life without God is meaningless. The speaker, Joe Heschmeyer (a wonderful and super-charitable Catholic Apologist with Catholic Answers), explores this concept through the lens of various philosophers and thinkers, including Friedrich Nietzsche, Dr. Ralph Lewis, Sam Harris, Francis Collins, and Yuval Noah Harari. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>Joe argues that if God does not exist, then life has no objective meaning, a point that many atheist philosophers agree on. He also discusses the connection between meaning and morality, and how morality cannot exist without a goal or purpose. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>Heschmeyer then critiques the arguments that try to find objective meaning in science, culture, or personal choice, stating that these are insufficient and ultimately subjective. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>He concludes by asserting that the existence of objective meaning in life points to the existence of God.</span></p>
