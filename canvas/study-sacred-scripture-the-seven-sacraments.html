<p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:155"><span class="animating">According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC), </span><span class="citation-0 citation-end-0 animating">a sacrament is "an efficacious sign of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us."</span><span class="animating"> (CCC 1131)</span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:75"><span>This definition highlights the following important points about sacraments:</span></p>
<ul data-sourcepos="5:1-5:16">
<li data-sourcepos="5:1-5:16"><span>They are signs,</span><span>&nbsp;which means that they are visible/physical symbols of something invisible,</span><span>&nbsp;namely,</span><span>&nbsp;God's grace.</span></li>
<li data-sourcepos="6:1-6:54"><span>They are efficacious,</span><span>&nbsp;which means that they actually produce what they signify.</span><span>&nbsp;In other words,</span><span>&nbsp;when we receive a sacrament,</span><span>&nbsp;we truly receive God's grace.</span></li>
<li data-sourcepos="7:1-7:41"><span>They were instituted by Christ,</span><span>&nbsp;meaning that they are not human inventions,</span><span>&nbsp;but rather gifts from God.</span></li>
<li data-sourcepos="8:1-8:124"><span>They are entrusted to the Church,</span><span>&nbsp;meaning that the Church is responsible for celebrating and administering the sacraments.</span></li>
<li data-sourcepos="9:1-10:0"><span>They dispense divine life to us,</span><span>&nbsp;meaning that they help us to grow in our relationship with God and to become more like Christ.</span></li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:303"><span>The CCC goes on to explain that the sacraments are "necessary for salvation" (CCC 1129).</span><span> The church does not teach that the seven sacraments are the only way to receive Salvation, but they are the ordinary ways that the Church dispenses God's Grace for all people and all time.</span><span> However,</span><span> it is important to note that the sacraments are not "magic spells".</span><span> They only work if we receive them with faith and with a sincere desire to grow in our relationship with God.</span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:53"><span>Here are the seven sacraments in the Catholic Church:</span></p>
<ul data-sourcepos="15:1-22:0">
<li data-sourcepos="15:1-15:9"><span>Baptism</span></li>
<li data-sourcepos="16:1-16:14"><span>Confirmation</span></li>
<li data-sourcepos="17:1-17:11"><span>Holy Eucharist</span></li>
<li data-sourcepos="18:1-18:16"><span>Reconciliation</span></li>
<li data-sourcepos="19:1-19:23"><span>Anointing of the Sick</span></li>
<li data-sourcepos="20:1-20:13"><span class="animating">Holy Orders</span></li>
<li class="animating" data-sourcepos="21:1-22:0"><span class="animating">Matrimony</span></li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:172"><span class="animating">Each sacrament has its own unique meaning and purpose,</span><span class="animating"> but they all share the common goal of helping us to grow in our relationship with God and to become more like Christ.</span></p>

<p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:86">The seven sacraments ALL have Scriptural backing (even though they are not named as "sacraments" in the Bible (although Reconciliation is!)</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:23">Here are some examples:</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:12"><strong>Baptism:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li data-sourcepos="7:1-8:0">
<p data-sourcepos="7:3-7:57">Matthew 3:13-17: Jesus is baptized by John the Baptist.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="9:1-10:0">
<p data-sourcepos="9:3-9:126">John 3:3-5: Jesus tells Nicodemus that he must be "born again of water and the Spirit" in order to enter the kingdom of God.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="11:1-12:0">
<p data-sourcepos="11:3-11:180">Acts 2:38: Peter tells the crowd <span class="citation-0 citation-end-0">on the day of Pentecost when they were "cut to the heart" - what they are to do - he tells them to a) Repent, b) be Baptized for the forgiveness of sins and that they will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. That is what the Church says happens in the Sacrament of Baptism.&nbsp; We do Baptism because Jesus tells us to.</span></p>

<li data-sourcepos="15:1-16:0"><span>Acts 2:</span><span>1-17 describes the coming of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost,</span><span> which is a significant event in the history of the Church.</span><span> It is the day when the Holy Spirit was given to the disciples and to all believers,</span><span> and it is the day when the Church was officially born.</span></li>
<li data-sourcepos="15:1-16:0">
<p data-sourcepos="15:3-15:213">Acts 8:14-17: When the apostles in Jerusalem hear that Samaria has accepted the word of God, they send Peter and John to them. When Peter and John arrive, they pray for the Samaritans to receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="17:1-18:0">We do Baptism because Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to confirm their Faith and send them out to all the nations!</li>

<p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:14"><strong>Eucharist:</strong></p>
<ul data-sourcepos="21:1-28:0">
<li data-sourcepos="21:1-22:0">
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:89"><span>John 6 is the chapter in which Jesus gives the Bread of Life discourse.</span><span> In this discourse,</span><span> Jesus teaches that he is the bread of life and that those who eat his flesh and drink his blood will have eternal life.</span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:17"><span>This discourse is significant because it foreshadows the Eucharist,</span><span> which is the sacrament in which we receive Jesus' body and blood.</span><span> It also teaches us that Jesus is the source of all life and that we need him to sustain us on our spiritual journey.</span></p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="21:1-22:0">
<p data-sourcepos="21:3-21:416">Matthew 26:26-28: Jesus institutes the Eucharist at the Last Supper.

He then tells them to take and drink the cup, saying, <span class="citation-1 citation-end-1">"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."</span></p>
