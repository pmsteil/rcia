<blockquote>
<p><span>"I believe that you, O Jesus, are in the most holy Sacrament. I love you and desire you. Come into my heart. I embrace you. Oh, never leave me. May the burning and most sweet power of your love, O Lord Jesus Christ, I beseech you, absorb my mind that I may die through love of your love, who were graciously pleased to die through love of my love. Amen."</span></p>

<p><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/alphonsus-liguori-saint" target="_blank">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a> (<span>1696–1787) </span>offered this prayer for those who wish the spiritual benefits of Spiritual Communion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My Jesus, I believe that Thou art present in the Blessed Sacrament. I love Thee above all things and I desire Thee in my soul. Since I cannot now receive Thee sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. As though Thou wert already there, I embrace Thee and unite myself wholly to Thee; permit not that I should ever be separated from Thee. Amen.</p>
