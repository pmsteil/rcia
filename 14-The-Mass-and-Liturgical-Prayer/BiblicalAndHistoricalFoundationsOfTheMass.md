- **Historical:** The Sign of the Cross has been a tradition in the Christian Church for centuries. While there may not be a specific historical event associated with its introduction, early Christian writings, such as the writings of Tertullian in the 3rd century, mention the practice.

### **Greeting (Early Centuries)**
- > **2 Timothy 4:22 (NABRE)**: "The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with all of you."
- **Historical:** The exchange of greetings in the Mass reflects a general atmosphere of communal worship. While specific historical references may be challenging to pinpoint, the practice of greeting each other in a worship setting has been a part of Christian tradition from early times, fostering a sense of community among believers.

### **Confiteor (4th Century)**
- > **Nehemiah 9:2 (NABRE)**: "The descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, then stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their ancestors."
- > **Leviticus 5:5-6 (NABRE)**: "when someone is guilty in regard to any of these matters, that person shall confess the wrong committed, 6 and make reparation to the Lord for the wrong committed: a female animal from the flock, a ewe lamb or a she-goat, as a purification offering. Thus the priest shall make atonement on the individual’s behalf for the wrong."
- > **Luke 18:13 (NABRE)**: "But the tax collector stood off at a distance and would not even raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast and prayed, 'O God, be merciful to me a sinner.'"
- **Historical:** The Confiteor has roots in the penitential practices of the early Church. Historical evidence points to the development of penitential prayers and practices as early as the 4th century. Specific references may include early penitential manuals and liturgical texts.

### **Gloria (4th Century)**

The very first line is a direct quote from the Bible:
- > **Luke 2:14 (Douay-Rheims Bible)**: "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will."

The titles that the prayer ascribes to God:

#### "almighty"

and
- > **Philippians 2:11 (NABRE)**: "and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father".

- **Historical:** The Gloria has been a part of Christian liturgy since at least the 4th century. Early versions of the Gloria can be found in ancient liturgical manuscripts, and it became a more standardized part of the Mass over time. The Gloria is a hymn of praise to God, and it is sung or recited on Sundays outside of Advent and Lent, as well as on solemnities and feasts. It is omitted during Advent and Lent.


## Liturgy of the Word:
### **Proclaiming the Word of God (Early Centuries)**
- > **Exodus 24:7 (NABRE)**: "Then he took the book of the covenant and read it aloud to the people, who answered, 'All that the Lord has said, we will heed and do.'"

- **Historical:** The practice of reading from the Scriptures during the Mass has its roots in the synagogues of ancient Judaism. In the Christian context, evidence of regular readings from the Old and New Testaments can be found in early Christian liturgical documents, with specific passages from the Bible selected for public reading.

### ****Alleluia** (before the Gospel reading) (at least 4th Century)**
- > Psalms 113-118 (NABRE)
- > Revelation 19:1-9 (NABRE): "After this I heard what sounded like the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying: '**Alleluia**! Salvation, glory, and might belong to our God, for true and just are his judgments. He has condemned the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her harlotry. He has avenged on her the blood of his servants.' They said a second time: '**Alleluia**! Smoke will rise from her forever and ever.' The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sat on the throne, saying, 'Amen. **Alleluia**.' A voice coming from the throne said: 'Praise our God, all you his servants, [and] you who revere him, small and great.' Then I heard something like the sound of a great multitude or the sound of rushing water or mighty peals of thunder, as they said: '**Alleluia**! The Lord has established his reign, [our] God, the almighty. Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory. For the wedding day of the Lamb has come, his bride has made herself ready. She was allowed to wear a bright, clean linen garment.' (The linen represents the righteous deeds of the holy ones.) Then the angel said to me, 'Write this: Blessed are those who have been called to the wedding feast of the Lamb.' And he said to me, 'These words are true; they come from God.'"
- **Historical:** The singing of **Alleluia** before the Gospel reading has ancient origins. It reflects the joyous anticipation of hearing the Gospel message. Early Christian liturgical texts and manuscripts, such as those from the Byzantine tradition, include the **Alleluia** chant.

### **Standing for the Gospel Reading (at least 4th Century)**
- > **Nehemiah 8:5 (NABRE)**: "Ezra opened the scroll so that all the people might see it—for he was standing higher up than any of the people—; and, as he opened it, all the people rose."
- **Historical:** The practice of standing for the Gospel reading has deep historical roots. It symbolizes a posture of attentiveness and respect for the words of Jesus. Early Christian descriptions of liturgical practices, such as those found in the Apostolic Constitutions (4th century), mention standing for the Gospel.

### **Priest's Prayer before the Gospel Reading (Early Centuries)**
- > **Isaiah 6:6-7 (NABRE)**: "Then one of the seraphim flew to me, holding an ember that he had taken with tongs from the altar. He touched my mouth with it and said, 'See, now that this has touched your lips, your wickedness is removed, your sin purged.'"
- **Historical:** The priest's prayer before the Gospel reading is part of the broader tradition of preparing for the proclamation of the Word. Early Christian liturgical texts, including ancient sacramentaries and lectionaries, provide insights into prayers said by priests before the Gospel reading.


## Liturgy of the Eucharist:

Moses and Aaron and his sons used to wash their hands and feet there when they entered the tent of meeting; and when they approached the altar, they washed, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
- **Historical:** The offertory has ancient roots in the presentation of gifts for the Eucharistic celebration. Early Christian liturgical texts, such as the Apostolic Tradition attributed to Hippolytus (3rd century), describe the offering of bread and wine as part of the Eucharistic liturgy.

### **Washing of Hands (Ancient Origins)**
- > **Leviticus 30:18-21 (NABRE)**: "When they came to the altar to minister in the sanctuary, they washed, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
- **Historical:** The symbolic washing of hands by priests before the Eucharistic prayer has historical precedent in ancient Jewish rituals and early Christian liturgical practices. Specific references may be found in early sacramentaries and liturgical writings.

### **Offering of Incense (Ancient Origins)**
- > **Exodus 30:34-38 (NABRE):** The Lord said to Moses: "Take aromatic spices: thirteen pounds of pure myrrh, six and a half pounds of sweet-smelling cinnamon, six and a half pounds of sweet-smelling cane, and thirteen pounds of cassia—measured by the sanctuary standard—plus a gallon of olive oil. Prepare a sacred anointing oil, blended perfumed ointment, the work of a perfumer; it will be a sacred anointing oil. With this oil, anoint the meeting tent and the ark of the commandments, the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense and the altar of burnt offerings with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand. Consecrate them to make them most holy: whatever touches them will be consecrated."

- Let my prayer be incense before you; my uplifted hands an evening offering.

- > **Revelation 8:3-4 (NABRE):**
- > Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a gold censer.

Early Christian liturgical texts, including ancient liturgical manuscripts and writings of Church Fathers, feature the Sanctus.

### **Words of Institution (1st Century)**
- > **Matthew 26:26-28 (NABRE)**: "While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and giving it to his disciples said, 'Take and eat; this is my body. Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, 'Drink from it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed on behalf of many for the forgiveness of sins.'"

### **Anamnesis of Eucharistic Prayer (1st Century and Beyond)**
- > **Hebrews 7:27 (NABRE)**: "Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifice day after day, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did that once for all when he offered himself."
- > **Revelation 5:6 (NABRE)**: "Then I saw standing in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures and the elders, a Lamb that seemed to have been slain. He had seven horns and seven eyes; these are the [seven] spirits of God sent out into the whole world."
- > **Hebrews 8:2-3 (NABRE)**: "He is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle that the Lord, not man, set up. Now every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus the necessity for this one also to have something to offer."
- **Historical:** The Anamnesis, recalling the sacrifice of Jesus, has deep historical roots in Christian liturgy. Early Christian writings, such as the Didache (1st century) and liturgical texts like the Apostolic Tradition, emphasize the remembrance of Christ's sacrifice during the Eucharistic prayer.



1 Corinthians 16:2 (NABRE): "On the first day of the week each of you should set aside and save whatever one can afford, so that collections will not be going on when I come."

2 Corinthians 9:5-8 (NABRE): "So I thought it necessary to encourage the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for your promised gift, so that in this way it might be ready as a bountiful gift and not as an exaction. Consider this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each must do as already determined, without sadness or compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. Moreover, God is able to make every grace abundant for you, so that in all things, always having all you need, you may have an abundance for every good work."
